## Project Overview

**فَــزْعَــة** is an AI-powered assistant designed to simplify how government entities evaluate vendor proposals.

RFP reviews are usually manual, slow, and inconsistent. Our system helps teams extract requirements, compare submissions, and score vendors automatically — enabling faster and more objective decisions.

## Problem Statement

Evaluating multiple long proposals against complex RFPs leads to:

- Long review times  
- Human errors  
- Inconsistent scoring  
- Compliance risks  
- Delayed decisions  

---

## Proposed Solution

فَــزْعَــة uses a multi-agent AI system to:

- Extract RFP requirements  
- Understand vendor responses  
- Compare both sides  
- Score vendors  
- Produce a final ranking  

---

##  High-Level Flow

Upload RFP → Upload Proposals → Extract → Compare → Score → Rank.
