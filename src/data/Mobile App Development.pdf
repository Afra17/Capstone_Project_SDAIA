I.  INTRODUCTION

The  Boston  Public  Health  Commission  (the  “BPHC”)  will  be  creating  a  mobile  application  that  will
provide  real-time  information  about  Covid-19  prevention,  surveillance,  and  resource  to  residents  of

caregivers,  students,  school  personnel,  health  providers,  residents,  and  community  members)  to
understand the needs of the end users and identify the features and functionality that the  community
would like to see in the mobile application.

request additional information from any Proposer. While it is expected that a single award will result for
this  RFP  solicitation,  the  BPHC  reserves  the  right  to  award  negotiated  contracts  to  one  or  more

III.  SCOPE OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REQUIRED

A.

INTRODUCTION

The Boston Public Health Commission is currently seeking proposals for Mobile App Development Services.

The Boston Public Health Commission is soliciting the development of a mobile application that will provide
real-time information about Covid-19 prevention, surveillance, and resource to residents of the City of
Boston. This project will involve two distinct phases: 1) Solicit Community Input, Identify Features and
Functionality, Organize and Assemble Content; and 2) Mobile Application Development.

B.

SCOPE OF WORK

Project Management
The project will require a development team who understands waterfalls project management or
another fixed-price project management paradigm. The development of this app will be swift
- implementation is due on May 30, 2023. To succeed, the development team will quickly
gather the functional requirements, subject matter resources (including branding materials and
visual design elements), and data to incorporate into the application by the deadline.

Project Goal
The goal for this project is to develop a cross-platform mobile application equipped with a user-
friendly interface that facilitates user input on COVID-19 symptoms and disseminates
information pertinent to COVID-19 treatment protocols; testing sites, vaccine sites, and COVID-
19 resources in Boston.

User Types

Front-end Users (Residents of the City of Boston)
The residents will input information regarding COVID -19 symptoms including antigen tests
taken at home; the app will enable real-time information about Covid-19 prevention,
surveillance, and resources. disseminate information regarding up-up-to-date testing sites,
vaccine sites, and treatment protocols and resources.

Administrative Users
The BPHC ITS staff will identify BPHC staff users whose role is to manage the data regarding
the programs, resources, and materials served to the City of Boston resident users on the
application.

Database

The database will be hosted and integrated on BPHC – Microsoft Azure application platform
hosted by BPHC ITS Department. The vendor should work with BPHC ITS department staff to
create database services, store encrypted user data, and interface with the mobile and
administrator applications.

6

Front End Interface

The functions of the front-end user will be based on audience and staff feedback, surveillance,
resource, privacy, and HIPAA compliance. The interface will have three or more tabs or buttons.

1.  a form to gather input from residents regarding covid-19 symptoms.

2.  Real-time information on testing and vaccine information.

3.  Real-time information on treatment protocols.

Administrative Functions

These are functions that the application administrators will use and interact with.
BPHC wishes to have one or more administrative staff who can control several functions:

•  Administrators should be able to update or refresh content with the app.
•  Administrators should be able to edit or update app features and front-end interface.
•  Administrators wish to add, remove, and update data on the site as they learn of them in the

community.

Back End Functions

The developers will be responsible for creating several back-end functions to support the front-
end and administrative users noted above.

Infrastructure

The development team should host the application, on BPHC- Microsoft Azure cloud-hosted
solutions. It should be hardware agnostic, allowing users to view the material on their laptops,
tablets, and mobile phones. They should also be available as downloadable applications on the
respective app stores (Apple and Google). The application should be packaged for release via the app
stores.

Data
Pull data from sources via an API when appropriate.

Analytics
Administrators wish to track the use of this application. The developers are responsible for
configuring Google and Apple Analytics into the application. BPHC is interested in monitoring the
standard reports from Google and Apple Analytics on the audience, acquisition, and behavior of
users. We are not interested in explicitly knowing who these users are but in learning about the
users in aggregate. In addition, we would like the developers to configure their application and the
analytics so that reporting is human-readable. For example, when looking at the page title report,
the titles of the resources should be names, not URLs (“Locust Street Arts,” not
“app/result/?id=5738”). BPHC is also interested in the most frequently used queries and how
many/what results are given.

Use of data
The development team cannot use the data provided for any other purpose than to build and
support the application. Users should also be able to review the privacy statement for this
application at any time (See Appendix E)

7

Overall Design Feedback

Overall, the design would follow the Rule of Least Surprise, a general rule of design to “Do the least
surprising thing.” The app should be organized as a decision tree with users having data served to
the user as they answer more detailed-providing questions. The stigma of needing mental health
assistance remains very real for users. Focus group participants indicated the app should not look
like a mental health app but a resource app. The vendor must have a UX designer who would
provide a design sheet with color choices and navigation examples for use by the development
team. A Design Style Example, based on community input, is provided in Appendix F. The app
managers may consider sharing more information about the app, including a formal privacy
statement (as in Appendix E) and answers to some FAQs, such as

Is the app accessible offline/with no WiFi?

•
In addition, BPHC would provide real-time information about Covid-19 prevention,
surveillance, and resource:

Translation and ADA Support
In order to support use of this app by all in Erie BPHC, the development team needs to include
in their proposal methods to translate the app into other languages either through direct
translation, technical means (similar to Google Translate), or both. In addition, please identify
how your development will handle the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/).

Timeline for Development

This is a fast-tracked project, and the selected Proposer(s) should begin work upon executing the
contract with BPHC. Proposer(s) will develop the app in two phases, each with associated
deadlines. This deadline is non-negotiable. After the initial launch, Proposer(s) will submit the
responsive application to the associated app stores for Apple and Google. BPHC is aware that the
approval process can be time-consuming. All user types (see user types above) will use the
responsive web pages in their modern browser until that application process is completed.

Available Expertise

The vendor responding to this RFP will have access to expertise regarding the vision and function of
the application. The Steering Committee made up of BPHC staff, and the BPHC Executive Office, will
be available throughout the process.

The vendor should develop a service-level agreement (SLA) to establish expectations between the
vendor and the BPHC describing the products or services to be delivered, the single point for end-
user problems, and the metrics by which the effectiveness of the process is monitored and
approved.

C.

SCHEDULE

This is a fast-tracked project and the selected Proposer(s) should begin work upon execution of
the contract with the BPHC. The mobile application will be launched on or before May 30, 2023.

The selected Proposer will be required to provide regular reports and meet with a Steering
Committee made up of BPHC officials, and the BPHC Executive Office throughout the process. The
selected Proposer will be expected to meet with the Steering Committee on an agreed-upon
frequency throughout the project. The Proposer will need to establish a deliverable schedule with
